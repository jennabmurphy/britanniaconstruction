            <p>Mike built a large three-season covered porch for us in 2009. It was architecturally interesting due to its roof line and supporting structure of pillars which presented a couple of building challenges. Mike not only solved these but also enhanced the design to create extra space. He always went above and beyond and was an absolute pleasure to work with ... very professional and personable. He explained everything really well and was happy to answer all of our questions. We appreciated the way he kept us updated regarding all aspects of the project. Mike was always dependable - if he said he would start on Monday, he started on Monday. We love our new porch and especially the 'extra features' that Mike provided. We highly recommend Mike and his Britannia Construction team to anyone who wants a reliable and hassle-free building project completed on-time and with exceptional results.</p>

            <p>We have had Britannia do two construction projects for us.  We are very happy with both results.  Mike runs a professional organization and his team does a great job.  He took the trouble to really understand and deliver what we wanted.  He has a good eye for design and made some great suggestions for both projects that contributed to the end results that we wanted.  He is very knowledgeable and provides solutions on the fly.   And we particularly appreciate the fact that we can always get hold of him to ask a question or get an update.  </p>
